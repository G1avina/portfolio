            Hi, I'm Cedric Glavina, a 21-year-old computer science student in my third year at the university of Ottawa.
             I'm passionate about tech and currently exploring the fascinating world of coding. Outside of my studies,
            I enjoy spending time with my two cats, playing video games, and engaging in sports like volleyball and ultimate frisbee.
